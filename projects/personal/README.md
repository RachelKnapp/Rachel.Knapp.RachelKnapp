## Overview


#### Motivation

I want this page to be a very stylistic portrayal of my creative work and ideas. In this sense I hope to incorporate an about me section, a section of photography, my design portfolio, film excertps of my work and lastly my travel writing. I will target a mostly profressional audience in creative industries. This is a professional creative portfolio but also a fun way to ensure the I stay up to date with my creative work

#### Content

I want my page to look clean and I would like to incorporate some of my own photos and gradients to make it look coherent. I would also like to include internal links (to photos, videos and my other writings). I will also have an About Me page. 

#### Design

I want it to feel minimalist and stylish with a sleek font and justified text. I'm including a black and white picture of myself so that it doesn't distract from the photo back ground. The images I use will have borders so as not to detract too much from the synchronicity of the design. If I have extra time I will design myself a logo in Illustrator to include.

## Code

I'll have a header with my name and potentially a logo. Then I will have a toolbar with different options and access points to my different pages.
