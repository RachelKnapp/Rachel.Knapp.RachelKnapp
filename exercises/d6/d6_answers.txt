E1: GIT research 

1. 'git init' initializes the new Git repository and makes it possible for one to make changes to their code
2. 'git add' adds modified files to the queue to be committed later, whereas 'git commit' creates a new revision in the log
3. A staged file is ready to be committed - it has registered that the file has been modified, whereas a committed file has been changed in the repository and thus all changes are saved. 
4. git add-commit -m 'My commit message' 
5. how to unstage a file - 'git reset HEAD file'; how to go back to an older version - 'git checkout abcde file/to/restore'
6. In order to ensure code is easily mergeable with the codes of other coders
7. git checkout [revision] .
8. :q to quit (short for :quit)
:q! to quit without saving (short for :quit!)
:wq to write and quit (think write and quit)
:x to write and quit (shorter than :wq)
:qa to quit all (short for :quitall)

E2: Github research

1. What's the difference between GIT and Github?
	*Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history. GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. So they are not the same thing: Git the tool, GitHub the service for projects that uses Git. 
2. Why is Github a cool company?
	*Github is a cool company primarily because it functions as a social network for developers, which allows the flow of creative ideas across a highly interactive site. 
3. What does 'git push' do?
	To share the cool commits you've done with others, you can use 'git push' to push your changes to the remote repository. 
4. What does git pull do? How is it different from/same as git fetch and git merge?
	* 'git pull' runs git fetch with the given parameters and calls git merge to merge the retrieved branch heads into the current branch.
